Kristie Magazinovic  
I am currently studying a Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain and Logistics). Since Covid19 outbreak I decided to scale back on my full-time role as a National Fleet Manager for Hertz and focus on completing my degree. Studying through Open Universities has allowed me to pace my studies however this has been slow with a demanding job. I am now aiming to finish my degree in May 2021. I grew up on a working cattle and horse property and enjoy horse riding and spending time with my dogs. I also sing and play guitar in my spare time (Its cheaper than therapy). 
 
Kur Bol Kur 
I have no previous experience or knowledge in Information technology. My nationality is Sudanese. I do not have any higher education degrees, so to date my education level is equivalent to year 10. My native language is Thuɔŋjäŋ; which is more commonly known as Dinka, I can also speak Arabic and English. One fact about me that others may find interesting could be that I have experience in various farming industries, such as agriculture, horticulture and viticulture and that I previously had my own hobby farm with sheep, goats, pigs, cows, poultry and I had grown fodder, fruit and vegetables.

I enjoy cooking, baking, listening to music, watching Korean drama, and re-arranging and organising wardrobe. I am Sagittarius, and I am fair-minded, optimistic, hilarious, spontaneous, and honest. I am married to Ecuadorian-Australian who bring a laugher to the family. We have two gorgeous girls. They are 3 and 5 year old. My current goal is to finish a Bachelor of IT and build my IT career and try my best to be mom, student and wife
