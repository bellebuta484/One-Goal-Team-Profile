### Ideal Jobs


| Team Member | Ideal Job | Demand for Role | Job Description | Similarities | Differences | General Skills Required | IT Skills Required|Final Opinion on Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jordan Elkin | Software Engineer|Within Australia and the world there is an increasing demand for IT professionals. However, there is an increasing demand for software engineers in order to solve problems with technology | This is a job role as a Software Engineer working within a company that provides services for start-ups and other corporate entities. That require Software based solutions. These solutions include web design, server setup and support, providing technical support to customers that have been provided with custom Software that has been designed for them. | Is similar that it provides an Information Technology service to a customer that requires such a solution. Further, like most technology jobs, this job requires long hours, problem solving, designing and requires communicating to clients how and why this solution is appropriate for them. | Is different to other technology jobs as this requires a software approach to problems whereas job such as Systems Engineer require more of a hardware approach (i.e., physical components of the computer are managed instead of writing software).| - Critical Thinking - Problem Solving - Technical skills - Project management - Communication skills written/verbal. | - Knowledge of multiple programming languages - Knowledge of Integrated Development Platforms - Knowledge of cloud services such as AWS and Microsoft Azure - Knowledge of GitHub | Excellent role for people with strong mathematical and problem-solving skills. Moreover, this role has opportunities for workers to work remotely from home instead of an office like most other IT roles. However, this role may not accommodate people who wish a more physical role or a one that allows for a greater diversity of working environments |  
| Kristie Magazinovic | Head of Supply Chain & Logistics | Supply Chain distribution and procurement managers require a very high skill set level and the employment size isn't as large as many industries however future growth in this field is strong and demand for skilled experiences supply chain and logistics professionals remains high | An Executive level role for a large FMCG company responsible for managing all supply chain functions including procurement, contract management, manufacturing, import/exports & last mile delivery functions. Highly strategic role with a focus on business improvement and creating value in a competitive landscape | There are few similarities between this role and the other 3 however all roles will most likely be employed in a corporate or government environment. All roles will rely on IT technologies such as software and IT hardware to complete daily functions. In terms of skill sets there will be similarities in requirements for communication skills, strategy development skills, knowledge of software systems and an understanding of how Information Technologies impact businesses | The Role is very different to the other 3 listed as it is not an IT specific role nor is it even in the IT industry.  The role is heavily focused on commercial activities and while IT based tasks such as systems development will be an integral part of the role, this is more in the capacity of a commercial executive department head which follows a more conceptual and financial approach than systematic execution | - Leadership Qualities - Extremely high level of Commercial Accumen - People Management Skills - Communication Skills - Project Management - Strategy Development - Negotiation Skills - Budget preparation and Financial Management | - Knowledge of reporting software such as SQL, Python and tableau - Knowledge of ERP systems such as SAP and Oracle - Working knowledge - Broad understanding of commercial IT tools such as software, hardware and cloud storage | This is an excellent role for individuals with strong leadership attributes, strong negotiation skills and a high level of business acumen. The future demand for similar positions is strong and many of the IT skills, general skills and even qualifications are highly transferable to other senior and executive business management roles |  
|Kym Reilly | Telecommunication and Network Engineer | AS networks improve and grow across the globe, these roles become more and more sort after. Even with countries will already existing infrastructure will look at ways to improve what they have while countries that are just beginning to improve and maintain their network service will have a smaller demand but still have a demand non the less | The primary focus of this role is the installation, relocation, maintenance and expansion/ upgrade of IT network infrastructure systems in addition to the provision of remedial maintenance support on LAN and WAN Networks. Will also be responsible for design and commissioning of networks. Managing the design, installation and operation of the ICT system instance landscape, client and transport processes. Providing broad technical support for project build, test and solution deployment activities. Configure and manage all non-functional platform capabilities including job scheduling, output management, email, archiving, technical security, technical connectivity between software components. Managing an ethernet optical transmission system. Plan to test optical ethernet link. Specify architecture requirements and manage optical ethernet link | The way this job can be like the other three jobs listed above is that they are all set out to improve and streamline operations.They also require skills in the area of critical thinking to find solutions for problems that may not have even occurred yet. All these jobs take historical research data to review a current model and use it to implement a new and more effective model | Although this job has similarities to the others, there are a few variances also.A Telecommunication and Network Engineer would essentially have to have their systems up and working prior to the other three jobs above to take place.Without a working telecommunications network in place, the above become much harder to accomplish their tasks |
| Phimonrat Panaphong (Belle) | System Analyst | According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics data, IT professionals are in high demand, and the career outlook for systems analysts continues and expected to grow by 9% through 2028. System Analysts are often required to work overtime and out of regular hours to regulate the upgrades, solves, securing the interruption to business. | A System Analyst is responsible for maintaining and improving computer systems for an organization.  System Analysts require to troubleshoot and maintain data warehouse and data storage systems.  Regularly researching, assess and evaluate technology in the infrastructure. Understanding user needs and how to improve systems based on demand. Create cost analysis reports that highlight the cost of efficiency. Communicate with stakeholders and train users | System Analysts require similarity skills as the other jobs listed below. They need to have a good communication skill in verbal and writing, thinking ability, problem-solving and good knowledge of programming language | All the job roles have a different responsibility in their position. System Analyst is focusing on maintaining and improving computer systems. Work to optimise programs for users. The role is to advise employers and clients on which software they may need for their company, implement the software, and communicate with users to ensure the programs function correctly |- Critical thinking ability - Strong problem-solving capacity - High-level written and verbal communication skills - Project management skills - Knowledge of data modeling and data visualization tools |- Knowledge of how to operate business software applications such as SQL, Oracle and SAP. - Knowledge of hardware and software - Knowledge of programming language such as Java, C++ and Visual basic | I see the larger picture in resolving problems as a mother; we always think ahead. This role will reward me in so many ways such as solving complex problem, interacting with many different groups and functional areas allowed me to continue learning and understanding how different functions operate, and challenged with understanding discipline. It has also given me opportunities to grow in my career as a leader |

## IT TECHNOLOGIES 
 
### Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies 
**What Does it do?** 

Originally conceptualized by Satoshi Nakamoto, Cryptocurrencies burst onto the IT world stage in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin and received a great amount of interest from both investors and the media alike. Bitcoin was the first of its kind and characterised as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system which allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution such as banks (Hudson & Urquhart, 2019). A Cryptocurrency is more broadly defined as a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The key feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are not typically used by a central authority (such as a reserve bank) making them resistant to government intervention.  For this reason, many in the financial world consider cryptocurrency to be more of an investment than a legitimate currency. 

In order to support Bitcoins peer-to-peer transactional concept, Nakamoto developed a revolutionary technology known as Blockchain (Zhao, Fan & Yan, 2016, p1). A blockchain is a decentralized digital transaction ledger, maintained by a network of computers that do not rely on an intermediary or third party. Individual transaction data files (blocks) are created to include all data and have specific hash ID’s that include previous blocks Hash IDs so as to highlight their position in the chain. These Blocks are managed through specific software platforms that allow the data to be transmitted, processed, stored, and represented in human readable form (Kamilarisa, Fonts & Prenafeta-Boldύ, 2019, p640).  

The main idea of blockchain is a distributed database of records of transactions that are shared across participating parties. Every transaction is verified by the consensus of a majority of the participants in the system using various algorithms, making fraudulent transactions unable to pass verification. Once a record is created and accepted by the blockchain, it can never be altered (Zhao, Fan & Yan, 2016, p2). 

Since Bitcoins launch in 2008 many other cryptocurrencies have been introduced such as Libra (Developed by Facebook), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). Like most formal tangible currencies it has experienced drastic fluctuations in real value over the years. The Values of Cryptocurrency are determined like any other currency or investment by the exchange they are traded on and demand however an additional component of verifications and production of currency through mining also contribute to value. It is likely that cryptocurrencies are not just a fad and will continue to grow as more transitional financial institutions adopt the technology. 

While Blockchain entered the ecommerce sector as the technology behind cryptocurrencies, many large firms outside the finance sector can see the benefit of its superior data management capabilities and it is increasingly being adopted by companies such as IBM, Microsoft, MAERSK, Walmart and even Facebook to manage supply chains, improve customer relations and reduce the reliance on financial intermediaries such as banks.  

Blockchain Technology is a still a relatively new concept to both the IT world and the corporate world and it has garnished a reputation as an enigma due to a few key pitfalls. Blockchain Technology is an extremely large consumer of energy, meaning developers will need to address this major flaw to ensure the future success of the technology. Scalability is another serious issue, as it is a complex mechanism it is harder to scale up than traditional transactional technologies employed by companies such as Visa and other large financial entities. The Proof of Work step that is key to Blockchain technologies format can be overkill and contributes to the energy consumption issues. All pitfalls aside it is evident that blockchain will continue to be adopted by large corporate enterprises which will improve the investment into blockchain technology allowing developers funding and resources to address Blockchains main challenges.  

**Future Impacts** 

Barone (2019) reported in an article that appeared on Investopedia that several economic analysts have predicted that cryptocurrency will face massive changes as institutional money enters the market. There is also a possibility that cryptocurrencies will be floated on the NASDAQ which could potentially add credibility to the product and improve the investment into Blockchain technology.  

Stanford Law School Professor Joseph A. Grundfest, a former US Securities and Exchange Commissioner stated that Cryptocurrency’s future outlook was still very much in question but conceded that there would be many applications where cryptocurrency is a viable solution (Stanford Online, 2019). Should Cryptocurrencies continue to grow there would be a very real threat to formal financial institutions which could deem many bank and securities workers redundant in the future. 

There are numerous examples of how Blockchain has already been adopted by businesses to improve efficiency and reduce overheads. In 2016, IBM and Maersk launched a joint Blockchain based pilot program with the aim to improve the visibility of each shipment. Each participant in the supply chain had access to the progress of the shipment, tracking information and documentation and no one party could alter, delete, or append the record without the consensus of the others within the network. The project resulted in significant improvements in process efficiency, reducing processing times and decreasing wastage of perishable goods (Nandi et al, 2020, p.849). This example alone shows that should blockchain technologies be adopted in real world applications it is highly likely that many administrative and auditing positions could be rendered redundant. This follows a growing trend in many industries where technology is making manual and labour-intensive roles redundant in favour of automation. These positions however could be replaced by greater engagement of IT staff such as developers, data miners and network engineers. 

**Effects on Daily Life**

The effects on daily life for cryptocurrencies will be highly dependent on its growth over the next few years however direct impacts will not be felt by individuals at a base level like other IT technologies (such as Social Media or Smartphones). It is more likely that cryptocurrencies impact on global financial markets will have an indirect impact on consumers. There will be little impact to those that do not direct invest in cryptocurrencies in the near future as historical data has shown that cryptocurrencies are mostly treated as an investment and attract significant risk. 

Should cryptocurrencies follow the more traditional path set out by financial institutions as general currency they will have little noticeable impact on our daily lives and are more likely to be treated as just another ATM card in our wallet. Blockchain technologies however have the potential to impact our daily lives in the very near future albeit in a far more muted way. Many modern economists and supply chain specialists believe Blockchain is one of the most disruptive emerging technologies with the Gartner Hype cycle for Emerging Technologies naming it among the top 5 technology trends in 2018 (Morkunas, Paschen & Boon, 2019, p 295). Those that work in supply chain and logistics roles many experience immense benefits in the Blockchain space.  

### Autonomous Vehicles 
 
**What does it do?**

Over the past two decades there have been considerable integration of technologies into traffic management systems including wireless communication, digital processing, and sensing technologies. The aim is to improve sustainability and safety and reliability of the overall driving tasks (Mahmassani, 20106, p1140). This has birthed a new era where autonomous vehicles are no longer just the imagery of Sci Fi movies.  

An autonomous vehicle is a is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An Fully autonomous vehicle has the ability to go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does (Synopsis, 2021) 

The Car Manufacturing Industry recognises 6 distinct levels of Driving Automation. 

No Automation: This represents most vehicles on the road today. Although systems such as Emergency Breaking Mechanisms may be installed on the vehicle, The Driving task is manual and completely controlled by the driver. 

Driver Assistance: The lowest level of automation. Based on a single automated system to assist in driving the vehicle. Adaptive Cruise Control is a prime example of this level and has  

Partial Driving Automation: Many vehicles sold today (2020/2021 models) are at this level. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can control both the steering and breaking of a vehicle however fall short of full autonomy as the driver remains in the seat and can take control at any time. Using technologies such as LIDAR and RADAR, ADAS features include Forward Collision Mitigation systems, Lane Departure warning and correction, and Automatic Emergency Braking. As of 2020 in Australia some form of ADAS is required in a vehicle to achieve an ANCAP 5-star rating. 

Conditional Driving Automation: Very few vehicles are being manufactured today at level 3. These vehicles have “environmental detection” capabilities and are able to make informed decisions, such as accelerating past a slow-moving vehicle however still require human override (Synopsis, 2021). Audi (Volkswagen) have recently developed Traffic Jam Pilot which can steer, brake and accelerate on highways. This technology however can only be activated in countries with regulatory approval. (Motor Authority, 2020) 

High Driving Automation: These vehicles are almost fully autonomous however still retain the option for human manual override. These vehicles can operate in self driving mode however due to limited infrastructure and legislation they have geofencing restrictions (meaning they operate within confined environments with limited speeds) 

Full Driving Automation: Fully Automated vehicles are where the driving task is eliminated, and no human attention or intervention is required. These vehicles do not require steering wheels or acceleration/brake pads. Geofencing restrictions will be eliminated and vehicles will be able to operate in a way an experienced huma driver could operate the vehicle. Testing of such vehicles has been underway for some time now however contrary to popular believe Fully autonomous Vehicles are still a distant dream due to various concerns. 

Testing of High Driving Automation and Fully Autonomous vehicles has become the focus of considerable commercial investment. Google began testing driverless cars in the US in 2009 and as of 2016 had racked up over 2 million miles. Most recently, Nissan has started trialling driverless Taxis in Japan. (Channon, McCormick & Noussia, 2019, p2). While testing is already underway it will be some time before these vehicles are available to the general population. As Autonomous vehicles rely on a combination of various other technologies, the progression of Fully autonomous vehicles will depend on how its reliant technologies evolve. Improvements to LIDAR, RADAR, security systems and wireless connectivity hardware and software will be necessary to ensure governments are comfortable all risks have been mitigated and the vehicles are safe on the road.  

**What is the likely impact?**

Partial Automation is already benefiting drivers today with many people driving vehicles with level 1 or level 2 automation. As these technologies are still relatively new there isn’t sufficient data to determine the impact this will have on the general population and there are however there are various concerns around the impacts of vehicle automation as follows: 

Security Concerns: Many Proponents are concerned over the lack of digital security features in fully autonomous vehicles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles require the same safety features as most high-grade technologies due to the serious risk to human life should hacking be possible.  

Legal Issues: At present most nations do not have legislation that permits vehicles beyond a level 3. Legal issues are at the centre of the challenges to rolling our fully Autonomous vehicles including insurance liabilities however it will be impossible to predict all legal risks until more advanced forms of technology are available. (Channon, McCormick & Noussia, 2019, p3) 

Signage and Road Quality: A seemingly simple concern poses a very real threat to the viability of fully autonomous vehicles. Signage must be clear and legible, lines on the road must be clean and not faded and roads must be of decent quality so as to not confuse onboard systems.  

Safety: There are also concerns about the “Judgement calls” a fully autonomous vehicle will need to make. Human drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviours. Can Autonomous vehicles mimic these behaviours to avoid harm or loss of life (Synopsis, 2020).  

Although Autonomous vehicles are still a fair way into the future the changes to the daily lives of the general population will be immense. While there is little risk of mass job losses in the auto manufacturing sector, there may be a very real threat to less skilled workers in the aftermarket section as autonomous vehicles often require less maintenance (in the case of electric autonomous vehicles) or highly skilled technicians for maintenance services and repairs. This is also the case with the accident repair sector.  

**How will this affect You?** 

The revolutionary technology of Autonomous vehicles will drastically change the everyday lives of the general population. As transportation technology evolves, more Automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are announcing they are planning on introducing new kinds of vehicles into the automobile market. Such vehicles include Autonomous (AV) and Connected Vehicles (CV) as well as Electric Vehicles (Kopelias et al, 2020). A recent study by MIT investigated autonomous vehicle mobility, employment and policy and determined that self-driving vehicles will happen later than sooner. The MIT study did however suggest that automation would start in the transportation and long-haul trucking industry first.  This is due to the industry dealing primarily with highway driving which reduces the requirement for more complex programming associated with busy urban traffic congested roads (Fisher 2020). Those working in trucking, transportation and logistics industries will see benefits in their working environments as automation and telematics technology improves so will commercial outcomes in these businesses.  

When Fully Autonomous do become available to the general population there will be immense benefits to drivers and pedestrians alike. The most notable will be Lower incident rates and reduction in the severity of incidents. The RACV (2020) notes that with human error contributing to more than 90 per cent of crashes, automated vehicles have enormous potential to reduce the road toll. This would result in fewer road accidents and less fatalities. Another benefit will be lower insurance premiums, as the number of incidents drops overall so to will insurance premiums. There is however one pitfall to autonomous vehicles and that will be the cost to purchase and the cost to maintain. Maintenance costs have already risen in level 2 vehicles with the increase in cost to replace a Windscreen with ADAS technology (opposed to Non ADAS vehicles) resulting a 300-500% price increase due to increased hardware cost, additional setting times and the need for static and dynamic calibrations. 
 
### Cybersecurity	 
**What does it do?** 

Cyber Security is the protection of computer systems and networks, in order to mitigate damage to hardware, software, and electronic data. This also, includes the ability to halt unauthorised, outside access that can result in data being stolen (What is Cyber Security, 2021).  Therefore, numerous tools have been developed in order to assist Cyber Security these include, Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics, which allows for the monitoring of how users use programs and then reports an incident when there are discrepancies, Hardware Authentication Systems which allow for physical chips on devices to authenticate logins instead of passwords and pins developed by users. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence which scans and analyses systems to ensure integrity, and Block Chain technologies such as DLT have also been developed to ensure file integrity and safety by ‘group validation’. (Cybersecurity Technologies You Should Be Aware of in 2020 - DZone Security, 2021).   

Moreover, within the next three years these technologies will be expanded upon in order to better mitigate threats. A current example can be seen within Artificial Intelligent (AI), which can currently analyse systems and monitor actions in order to mitigate threats will in future be able to better perform these actions (Future of Cybersecurity: 4 Evolving Technologies | Managed IT Services and Cyber Security Services Company | 24 X 7, 2021). This is due to advancements in how AI algorithms are created and advancements in Machine Learning which help facilitate the creation of new algorithms and, allow for machines to respond to situations that they have already experienced (The Future of AI & Cybersecurity, 2021). However, these advancements will also lead to the development of ‘hostile AI’ that create malware and launch attacks. This will cause a continuous development of ‘defensive AI’ and formulate the basis for extended advancements within this space (The Future of AI & Cybersecurity, 2021).  

Furthermore, other areas of future advancement include the Zero-Trust security model which mitigates security threats by not trust anything on any networks by default (Bhardwaj, Madki and Adhikari, 2021).  This area allows for further security enforcement by forcing devices and users on the network to keep authenticating in order to use the services on the network. In the future this model will utilise other technologies such as AI and hardware authentication to allow for quicker, and more convenient access to the network and also shape how the network interacts with devices by not allowing devices that do not use the same security protocols (Bhardwaj, Madki and Adhikari, 2021).  

Further, future advances can be found in the development of defensive Cyber Security technologies by nation states and corporations. (What Will Cybersecurity Look Like 10 Years From Now, 2021).  This is due to the ever, increasing threats from unknown actors through the internet.  The advancements within these defensive technologies will allow for automated systems that do not require human analysts to mitigate security threats and the inclusion of predictive systems that can predict what future attacks will be and mitigate them effectively (cybersecurity: &hellip, 2021). Furthermore, the advancements within this area will lead to defensive technologies that are multi-layered and integrated within systems. However, legacy systems will have to be upgraded in order to ensure compatibility with these new defensive technologies (What Is Multi-Layer Security and How Can, 2021).  

**Future Impacts** 

With continuous advances in the Cyber Security space there will be several impacts upon jobs, and current technologies used by companies and nations. Furthermore, these impacts will affect people working in a Cyber Analyst role the most. This is because the requirements for these job roles will change as advancements in security technologies evolve (A Glimpse into the Future of Cybersecurity, 2021). Furthermore, advances in Cyber Security technologies will affect jobs, which is due to current and continuing advances in Artificial Intelligence. This is because Artificial Intelligence will be able to fully automate the entire Cyber Security process. This includes, threat detection, threat mitigation techniques, analysis of all systems on the network for security flaws and prediction of future attacks (The Future of AI & Cybersecurity, 2021). Thus, Artificial Intelligence will affect jobs such as ‘Cyber Analyst’ as these roles will no longer be required as Artificial Intelligence becomes more advanced. 

However, without the usage of advanced AI by companies more and more Cyber Security professionals will be required in order to mitigate Cyber Security threats. This is because as these advancements are made to mitigate threats, criminals and other organisations are continuously evolving their measures to attack systems (A Glimpse into the Future of Cybersecurity, 2021). 

Moreover, current technologies will be affected as well. This is because in future they will become outdated and their vulnerabilities can become quickly exploited (How New Technologies Affect Cyber Security - Cyber Security Solutions, Compliance, and Consulting Services - IT Security, 2021).  Further, these systems may not be compatible with future technologies such as AI or other automated systems. Thus, causing their effectiveness as a Cyber Security solution to be lessened. Therefore, existing systems will become replaced with much more sophisticated, automated systems that can better mitigate threats (Ten Ways Evolving Technology Affects Cybersecurity, 2021).   

**Effects on daily life**

Through future developments in Cyber Security daily life will also be affected. This will be through increased security measures on personal devices such as PCs and Smartphones. This is because, consumers and other users are also vulnerable to Cyber Security threats and these must be mitigated using the latest technologies available in order to remain effective (Why is Cybersecurity Important? | UpGuard, 2021). Moreover, these advancements will have impacts on how people utilise resources at work. This is because, companies will also expand their security systems to utilise the latest Cyber Security measures. Some examples of these systems are, Hardware Authentication systems that allow only people with the correct devices to gain access to systems and, stops unauthorised people from accessing information on the network (i.e. a user trying to open files that they are not allowed to or trying to install software when they do not have rights to) (Future of Cybersecurity: 4 Evolving Technologies | Managed IT Services and Cyber Security Services Company | 24 X 7, 2021).   

Furthermore, there will also be changes to how payments are processed and authenticated by Banking Institutions and other businesses.  This can be seen currently through the rise of NFC in phones in order to conduct EFTPOS transactions and, biometric data such as ‘Face ID’; which are all forms of hardware authentication.  In future this will be expanded upon to become more secure and utilise more advanced forms ((TechCrunch is now a part of Verizon Media, 2021).  Moreover, other areas that will be impacted in daily life include the utilisation of better encryption algorithms in order to better safeguard data. Further, the utilisation of Artificial Intelligence programs within the consumer space will provide real-time threat mitigation on consumer grade networks from their personal devices.  
 
### Machine Learning 
**What Does it Do?**

Machine learning is the process whereby, machines improve their algorithms through ‘their’ experiences (Mitchell, 2013). This is done through a compilation of data sets known as ‘training data’ which the computer uses as its base in order to build its own model and make its own decisions about the subject matter that was designed to handle.  Some examples of areas which utilise machine learning are search engines, computer vision, and email filtration systems. Moreover, currently, there are four learning approaches that Machine Learning utilises these are; Supervised learning where computers are presented with inputs by a person and given feedback as well, Unsupervised learning where only data sets are given to the learning algorithm, reinforcement learning where a machine has a goal and must uses its data to complete said goals such as driving a car or general navigation, and lastly deep learning which utilises artificial neural networks, and highly structured data sets for learning algorithms to examine (What Is Machine Learning? | How It Works, Techniques & Applications, 2021).   

Furthermore, current applications of this technology include gaming, driverless vehicles, healthcare and government services (Media Nesta, 2021). Machine learning is utilised in gaming to provide inexpensive play-testing capabilities for game developers. Furthermore, machine learning also provides a way for developers to create new procedurally generated worlds by allowing algorithms to create levels based on the input data that makes up the specifications. Also, this technology allows for the creation of advanced in game Artificial Intelligence systems by the game adapting its strategies to how the player plays the game (How artificial intelligence will revolutionise the way video games are developed and played, 2021).  In future this technology will allow the creation of much more dynamic, and responsive games. This will be achieved by the increases in the learning algorithm’s ability to process data sets and then provide real-time updates to the user within the game (6 Ways Machine Learning will be used in Game Development | Logikk, 2021).  Moreover, improvements in machine learning can provide better updates to how game textures are loaded into the game decreasing lag within the game and also, ensure better modelling of systems that the game relies on to function properly. 

Moreover, the utilisation of machine learning in healthcare can be seen through the utilisation of intelligent healthcare recording. Further current uses in healthcare include prediction of future illness and treatments for them. This is done through the use of patient’s medical records to create a model for which to accurately predict what may occur. Further, this technology is also utilised to assist with the interpretation from imaging technologies such as MRI scans and x-rays.  This has allowed for quicker diagnosis speeds and more accurate diagnosis’ (15 Examples of Machine Learning in Healthcare That Are Revolutionising Medicine, 2021).  In the future, this will enable uses of Artificial Intelligence in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to give prognosis’ for patients online without reliance on going to see a doctor physically where possible (15 Examples of Machine Learning in Healthcare That Are Revolutionising Medicine, 2021). Further, this technology will allow for better predictions of when and where a potential pandemic may occur by using global health information and examining the types of infections that are occurring within given population densities. An example of this can be seen with COVID-19 where models were used to assist in the management of pandemic (Predicting the growth and trend of COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning and cloud computing, 2020). 

**Future Impacts** 

As Machine Learning advances and algorithms advance there will be numerous impacts on business. These future impacts include increases in revenue and growth, increases in time efficiency and processing times, increases in capital savings and increases in investment (Business Impacts of Machine Learning, 2021).  These impacts are caused by machine learning’s ability to automate simple to complex tasks without human intervention. Moreover, machine learning can provide revenue and growth by allowing a company to spend less money on human workers and can then further reinvest into growing the company. Furthermore, machine learning can, in the future, conduct processing of data faster and even in real-time thus providing a further increase to both revenue and growth. An example of this is call centre customer processing where a machine can re-direct calls and even solve solutions for customers faster and cheaper than a human operator could, which is a direct result of machine learnings adaptive learning algorithms (Business Impacts of Machine Learning, 2021).  

 Moreover, machine learning is able to provide increases in investment by providing companies a way to process user data and then able to pass on recommendations such as displaying advertisements to customers. This is done through multiple data collection systems which the machine learning algorithm is able to use as a basis to form its models. Such examples include behavioural targeting where the machine is able to decide which products a customer buys the most and then is able to display relevant advertisements for similar products. This process increases investment by showing current and future investors that the company is worth investing in due to how effective it can be in increasing revenue (Science Direct, 2021). 

**Effects on daily life** 

As machine learning leads to increased capabilities for Artificial Intelligence there will be effects on how this technology influences our lives. Some of these impacts include the enabling of driverless cars, intelligent gaming systems, automation systems and chatbots. Through machine learning driverless cars will become much more prevalent and a more viable option in the future for transportation within high density cities and environments (Top 10 Machine Learning Applications and Use Cases in Our Daily Life, 2021).  This will enable better traffic control systems that will not require human intervention or controls such as a traffic light system. This is because through machine learning driverless systems will be able to communicate with each vehicle in real-time and be able to quickly identify the quickest way to move all vehicles through intersections.  Moreover, machine learning will lead to the creation of more sophisticated and advanced chatbot systems. These chatbots will be able to better understand what people are asking and then decide on how to answer these questions more accurately. Examples of this can be seen with the rise in usage of personal assistance in phones and other devices such as Siri which utilise models constructed from peoples’ voices and the feedback given on its answers to make decisions. (Top 10 Machine Learning Applications and Use Cases in Our Daily Life, 2021). Furthermore, 

Intelligent gaming systems will become widespread allowing for the creation of highly immersive games that base themselves on how users play the game and do not rely on pre-compiled scripts. Some examples of this currently occurring is with games creating new landscapes from information that is pre-designed by a designer and joined together during gameplay depending on the user.
